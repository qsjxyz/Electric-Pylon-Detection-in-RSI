Deep Learning Based Electric Pylon Detection in Remote Sensing Images  
## Dataset
In this repository, we try to use deep learning method to detect electronic pylons in remote sensing images. We provide a dataset which contains 1500 remote sensing images. Dateset can be found at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zCVAmcldxAupEi1d9oe27Q, password is ld2b.
The link above is no longer valid, we update our dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/qiaosijia/epd-dataset.
## Code
We also offer ten deep learning models which contain Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, Grid R-CNN, Libra R-CNN, Retinanet, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, Retinanet FreeAnchor, FCOS and Retinanet FSAF.  
For time reasons, we uploaded a zip of unpolished code, and the code is still being sorted out. Detailed code and usage details of the code are expected to be uploaded by July 15, 2020.
